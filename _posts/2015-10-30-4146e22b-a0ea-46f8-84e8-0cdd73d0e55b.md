**I do the most amazing thing**; I educate others about natural health and empower them to take control of their own healthcare.  That means I teach them how to save money by becoming more self sufficient.   I travel all over the United States teaching an Intro to Essential Oils class.  My goal is to **inspire **you, to **motivate **you to make a change in your life and choose better health. Essential oils are effective at supporting our body physically and emotionally. We can't keep living like this...a life of discomfort, stress and poor health. This is my ministry. To help fathers, mothers, grandparents and all people have the confidence to release the fear and trust the natural medicine that God created for our purpose. To focus on Him and keep your lamps full of oil as we wait on His return. I believe that the power to heal comes from our Creator. I believe that the commitment to heal comes from us and the tools He gave us to use. It starts with faith in Him to provide a way.

I am wife to Cole Davis of [On That Day Ministries][0] and mother to our three children. I manage my business from home so that I can be with my family and school our children. My journey to using essential oils started after we had kids. I was looking for a better way to manage their health and a friend introduced me to essential oils on a camping trip and I knew this was just what we needed to be more prepared for life's little emergencies and be thinking ahead for the future whatever it may bring. After having so many amazing results with them, I decided to educate and empower others to reinvent their home health care. I work with families of all shapes and sizes to focus on their needs no matter how great or small they are.

Not only do I empower families take control of their own healthcare but I also get very excited about home birth and other natural parenting methods.  It was my original plan to train as a birth educator and eventually midwife.  BUT then I realized I can help so many more people as a natural health educator.

**Be Well!**
